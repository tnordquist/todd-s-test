# Curriculum template

## Source

This template is based on the <a href="https://pages-themes.github.io/leap-day/">Leap Day</a> theme, by <a href="https://twitter.com/mattgraham">mattgraham</a>.

## Use

Create a curriculum module (lesson, activity, assignment, practical exam problem) as follows:

1. Select this as a template when creating a new repository in GitHub, and clone the repository to your local system. 

    Alternatively, copy the `docs` directory from a local clone of this repository to the target repository on your local system.

2. Add additional directories &amp; files, as necessary, for code &amp; libraries.

3. Develop code in the usual fashion, committing to Git and pushing to GitHub as appropriate.

4. Edit `docs/_config.yml` to set the site title, description, and other site-level metadata.

5. Edit `docs/index.md` and create additional documentation files (all in `docs` or a subdirectory of `docs`) as necessary.

6. Edit the front matter of `docs/index.md` (and other `.md` files, as appropriate) to set page title, description, and other page-level metadata.

7. Commit changes, additions, and deletions to Git as usual, and push to GitHub.

8. Modify the repository settings in GitHub to enable GitHub Pages, using the `docs` directory of the `master` branch as the source.

9. After any documentation changes, be sure to commit, push, and then review the appearance of the GitHub Pages web site.
